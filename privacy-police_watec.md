# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Our privacy policy will help you understand how **Watec** manages your data in the **Watec** application. This service is provided by **Watec** and is intended for use as is.

By using our Service, you agree that certain data may be collected when using the application, especially when signing in with your Google account. This policy explains our approach to privacy and data security. The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are available on our website, unless otherwise defined in this policy.

## Information Collection and Use When Signing in with Google
When you sign in using your Google account through the **Supabase Auth** authentication system, we automatically receive from Google the following information:
- Your email address

- A unique identifier for your Google account

This information is used solely for:
- Creating and managing your account within the application
- Verifying your identity when logging in

This data is securely stored on **Supabase** servers and is not shared with any third party, except Google as part of the login process.

## No Other Personal Data Collection and Use
Except for the above, we do not collect any other personally identifiable information such as gender, location, or any other private data. No additional personal data is stored, used, or shared.
